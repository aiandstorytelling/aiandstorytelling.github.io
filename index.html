                    Stories are the fundamental way people share experiences and make sense of the world. They surprise us, delight us, inform us, open our eyes, and connect us to others. They make us think and feel.

                    Generative AI has startling abilities to generate content, but that doesn't necessarily make its creations interesting or meaningful to people.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    How can we use AI to express and share experiences in new ways?
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    This is a studio-style class focused on making and sharing our creations. Typically, we create and share on social media.
                    The staff have experience using AI to create and share stories in text, image, and video formats. Our recent focus has been on video, but all mediums of storytelling are equally interesting to us.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    As we create we will also reflect and share our thoughts on questions about the nature of AI and storytelling:
                    
                    <ul> 
                        <li>In what ways does AI impact the storytelling process?</li> 
                        <li>What new possibilities does AI create for storytelling?</li> 
                        <li>How do we channel our experiences, intentions, thoughts, and emotions into AI?</li> 
                        <li>How do audiences perceive the stories we tell through an AI medium?</li> 
                        <li>What is the role of human creativity in the age of AI?</li> 
                    </ul>
                    We will publish blog posts, position papers, video essays, and other works to share our thoughts with the world.
                    <br><br>
                    We aim to do a majority of the creating during studio time, which is <b>Wednesdays 3-6pm</b> in CSB 453.

                    This video captures the phrasing and emotions of a song clip through abstract moving imagery. We used AI to analyze the music and identify beats and salient moments in the clip. While AI served as a starting point, the annotations were made by people based on the AI’s analysis. Using the segments of the song as visual "scenes," we created imagery that reinforces the beats visually, primarily through motion speed and zoom levels. Additionally, color was used to convey aspects of the emotional trajectory and energy of the song.

AI assisted in analyzing the audio and generating visual elements, but the interpretation of the music—and its transformation into visual forms—was entirely human-driven.

                    This is a "news reel" - a way of telling journalistic stories on social media. This was made for the Syracus University news station - NCC News -as a part of a similar studio class for making news on social media with AI. AI is capable to reframing traditional print media into social media "role plays", and then generating script and storyboards for the video, which journalists film. AI makes suggestions and allow people to explore multple options, but people are responsible for preserving the message, ensuring the information is salient, engaging, and conveyed with the appropriate tone. This video had over 273,000 views in December 2024.
